# 00 [OVR-001] dev-foundry-claude - System Overview

## 1. Purpose

`dev-foundry-claude` is the greenfield runtime adapter that makes DEV FOUNDRY
usable natively from Claude Code while preserving repository-owned product
authority, bounded execution, independent review where required, minimal
sufficient change, and Operator control.

DEV FOUNDRY reusable methodology is not owned by this repository. This project
explicitly adopts immutable canonical DEV FOUNDRY 2.1.0 from
`.dev-foundry/releases/2.1.0/`.

## 2. Project Boundary

The project MAY provide Claude Code bootstrap instructions, context-resolution
tooling, Skills, subagents or agent-team integration, hooks or deterministic
guards, test fixtures, test harnesses, and other adapter-specific runtime support
when separately governed.

The project SHALL NOT embed or recreate the runner merely to read or mutate the
same repository from Claude Code. The runner and this adapter are distinct
runtime integrations.

The project SHALL NOT duplicate the adopted DEV FOUNDRY release into project
prompts, Skills, summaries, or local OPS/DAT copies as a parallel methodology
source.

## 3. Current Goals

The approved direction is to:

- minimize model cost caused by repeated authority reconstruction;
- preserve repository SoT while enabling deterministic minimal-context retrieval;
- use Claude Code native mechanisms when they materially improve the adapter;
- preserve role separation and explicit Operator authorization;
- keep provider authentication, credentials, enterprise routing, and private
  launcher configuration outside reusable methodology and project SoT unless a
  concrete non-secret contract requires them.

## 4. Current Non-Goals

The current adoption boundary does not authorize:

- product implementation;
- an active Implementation Executor or Capability Profile;
- a context resolver implementation;
- Skills, hooks, subagents, agent teams, or product `CLAUDE.md` behavior;
- automatic authentication handling;
- copying runtime implementation or task history from another project.

Those require separate project authority and a governed task.

## 5. Current State

The repository remains in greenfield governance bootstrap.

Canonical DEV FOUNDRY 2.1.0 is the selected reusable methodology.
The local Project Operating Profile and Authority Index bind that release to
`dev-foundry-claude`.

No product TSK is active.
The Implementation Executor binding is deferred.
No product execution is authorized.

The next product task may be activated only after this 2.1.0 adoption boundary is
validated and reviewed as required, and the Operator explicitly authorizes that
task.
